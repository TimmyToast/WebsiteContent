			<h1>Making of Khadi</h1>
			<p>Khadi (from the Hindi word kh&#x0101;dar) is a term for hand spun and hand woven cloth from India, typically made out of cotton, silk or wool. The yarn is spun on a charkha (spinning wheel) and woven on a handloom. </p>

			<p>For Autum we have worked with spinners and weavers in India to create our own khadi in off-white silks and chambray blue cottons.</p> <P>The yarn for our khadi is hand spun by skilled women spinners. Working throughout the day they fit the spinning in between their domestic chores. In the spinning process fibres are drawn out and carefully twisted. The resulting yarn is dependent on many factors including fibre length and degree of twist. Yet the thickness is down to the skill of the spinner: the finer the yarn count, the more skilled the spinner. The people power required in hand spinning is vast - two spinners using an automatic machine can spin the same amount of yarn as one hundred hand spinners.</p>

			<p>The weavers spend their day filling the bobbins, dressing the warp yarns with flour and water (this makes them strong enough to withstand the weaving process), loading the shuttles and operating the big clattering looms. It takes the weavers two to three weeks to produce thirteen metres of loth.</p>

			<p>It is this obvious human handling which gives khadi its beauty. When woven from thicker thread, but even when extremely finely and accurately spun and woven - by the most highly skilled artisans - it still has this slight, lovely, organic unevenness, betraying the many hands that made it. Andt is this liveliness, these unexpected and unpredictable variations - impossible to reproduce by machine - which we love. </p>
