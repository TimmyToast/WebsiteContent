<p>Deliveries are made by DHL from 9am until 8pm and may require a signature. For this reason, you may like to nominate a secure delivery address where someone is available to sign.</p>

<p>Please be advised that some large products from our House&Home collection are dispatched from a separate warehouse. If your order contains items from House&Home along with items from our other collections they may not be delivered together. You will only be charged once for shipping for your complete order.</p>

<p>During our sale period, orders should be placed before midday, Monday to Thursday to qualify for next day delivery, orders placed on Thursday after midday, or Friday will be delivered the following Monday.</p>
