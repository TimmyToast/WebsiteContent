<h1>Size &amp; Fit</h1>
<h2>Sizing</h2>
<p>The following information is to help you select the correct size. Sizing charts can be a bore but used in conjunction with your own accurate measurements they will really help to obtain a good fit. If you don’t have time to measure yourself (life may be too short for that after all), just have a conversation with our operators who have been well trained on our sizing in general and on individual garments in particular.</p>
<p>You will also find some extra notes on the fit of certain garments on the individual product pages of the website.</p>

<h2>How to measure yourself really well.</h2>
<p>How you go about this makes an enormous difference to the accuracy of the measurements. This is our preferred method. In true Blue Peter fashion you will need a measuring tape, string, some sellotape and for one measurement, a good friend.</p>

<h2>Women's</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All measurements are best taken when you are wearing underwear only.</li>
    <li>Bust - Wear only a simple bra and measure around the bust at the fullest part. Make sure the tape is even around the back.</li>
    <li>Waist - We sometimes refer to three definitions of waist measurement – 'waist', 'below waist' and 'low waist'. To start, tie a length of string or knitting wool around your waist (this is much higher than you expect, it is the narrowest part). Then, measure with a tape around the position of the string. This is how we define the term 'waist'. 'Below waist' and 'low waist' are approximately 2.5cm and 5cm lower respectively. Leave the string on in order to take your next measurement.</li>
    <li>Hip - At the side of your hip, measure 20cm down from the string around your waist. Use the sellotape to mark this spot. Now measure around the hips at this point remembering to keep the tape level.</li>
    <li>Leg Length - Ask your (good) friend to measure from your crotch to where your trouser is usually worn on.</li>
    <li>Body length - this is always specified from the top of the shoulder.</li>
