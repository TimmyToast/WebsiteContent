<p>Due to shipping restrictions on certain items, we cannot dispatch any orders containing liquids or knives outside of the UK. Certain bulky House&Home items are not available for purchase or delivery outside of the UK.

<p>If your order is to be delivered outside the European Union, it may attract import duty and local sales taxes which customers will need to pay on receipt of the shipment. These rules vary by country and your local government determines duty and customs charges. All prices on our site are in pounds sterling and are inclusive of European Union sales tax (VAT) at the prevailing rate where applicable. If your order is being despatched outside the European Union (EU) then we will deduct VAT. When you are at your shopping bag page, you can select the intended destination for your order, and we will automatically calculate the relevant shipping and VAT.</p>
