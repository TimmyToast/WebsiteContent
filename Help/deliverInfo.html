      <h2>DUTY AND CUSTOMS</h2>        
      <p>If your order is to be delivered outside the European Union, it may attract import duty and local sales taxes which customers will need to pay on receipt of the shipment. These rules vary by country and your local government determines duty and customs charges.</p>
