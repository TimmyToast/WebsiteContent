<h1>Ethical Policy</h1>

<h2>We are committed to supporting organic production wherever possible within our ranges.</h2>
<p>
    International cotton production uses only 2.4% of the world's agricultural land but 25% of the world pesticide consumption. A single t-shirt can require about 100-150g of pesticides. This is damaging both for the planet and also for the growers who are exposed to these chemicals. Additionally, producing organically supports bio-diversity in the environment.
</p>
<p>
    We started using organic cotton in 2006 for a small range of T-shirts – just 7 styles. Since then we have increased our use of organic products by introducing several styles which are made from organic materials. Importantly most of our bedlinen and many other home products are made from organic cotton as well as some of our jersey and food products. We will continue to try to add to this range in the future.
</p>


<h2>WE DO NOT MAKE THROW-AWAY FASHION.</h2>
<p>
    Our design and technical teams work together closely and tirelessly, and without compromise, to ensure that our products are constructed from high quality raw materials (often from UK sources) and using construction details which will ensure longevity. The design phase is followed by thorough auditing of the production process to ensure production compliance with our high standards and corrective action when occasionally problems arise.
</p>
<p>
    All this makes for a product which is well designed and durable and will last much longer than cheap high street versions. It is better for the world and for you that they do.
</p>

<h2>We will only use animal products that
                are a by-product of the meat industry.</h2>
<p>
    We don't use skins or pelts of animals which are raised solely for obtaining their skins. Products such as shearling sheepskin, reindeer and the leathers for our shoes and bags come from animals which have been raised for food.
</p>

<h2>WE RECYCLE EVERYTHING WE CAN AND WE PACKAGE EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN DO THE SAME.</h2>
<p>
    In our stores and offices we have full recycling of everything from coke cans to ink cartridges, office equipment to hangers, paper and cardboard. All our packaging is either biodegradable or can be recycled. We try to keep it to a minimum too.
</p>

<h2>We will do whatever we can to limit our carbon output and our impact on the environment.</h2>
<p>
    The environmental pressures facing our planet are urgent and can only be solved by continuous effort. These are some of the ways in which we are tackling these vital issues at Toast.
</p>
<p>
    Our stores and our head office use electricity produced from wind-power by Ecotricity, the leading installer of wind farms and producer of wind-power energy.
</p>
<p>
    We limit power use in our stores and offices by using energy saving light bulbs and other power saving solutions and by creating shopfits that use recycled or re-used materials. We try to avoid air-conditioning in our stores wherever we can.
</p>
<p>
    We try to use transportation with the lowest carbon output: trains for our travel rather than cars, sea and road rather than air freight. Wherever possible we will make our products as close to home as possible.
</p>

<h2>Our toiletries are not tested on animals.</h2>
<p>
    Just that. They're not.
</p>


<h2>OUR RANGES ALWAYS INCLUDE PRODUCTS WITH A STORY.</h2>
<p>
    Over the years we have always preferred to seek out the unusual over the readily available; the hand-made over the mass produced; the considered over the rushed. These products will have often a story behind them – whether it is of an individual creative artisan maker, a traditional mill or a women’s co-operative in Africa.
</p>
<p>If you would like to read more about the stories behind our products then look throughout the website for more information on each individual product.
</p>

<h2>INTERNATIONAL TRADE CAN BE A FORCE FOR GOOD BUT OUR SUPPLIERS MUST ADHERE TO OUR POLICY ON SAFE AND FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.</h2>
<p>
    Our producers understand that our standards are high and we have worked with some of them for many years. This approach enables us to properly understand the nature of the operations we are working with.
</p>
<p>
    We do not operate in a market where cost-cutting is more important than working conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Our suppliers are required to comply with our code of conduct which lays down minimum standards for environmental, work and health &amp; safety issues. And through our regular visits to our suppliers we will work with them to ensure and monitor those standards.
</p>
<p>
    When sourcing we look for very high standards in factories to become a new Toast supplier.
