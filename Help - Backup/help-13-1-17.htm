                                                                                    <p>This fire bowl will work best if you use good, dry firewood as fuel and if you leave a bed of ash to accumulate between uses. This will help to build up a better fire base.</p>
                                                                                    <p>The firebowl is for outdoor use only and should be positioned on a non-flammable surface (not wooden decking!), away from any flammable objects. Remember not to leave it unattended while it has a fire or any fuel inside.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Over time, the iron will discolour and the surface will rust - especially with high temperatures. Storing under cover will help keep your fire bowl in good condition and your bed of ash dry, but do make absolutely sure the fire is out and the bowl cold before storage.</p>

                                                                                    <p>As Toast likes to use natural leathers in our shoe products you will notice subtle variations in colour or texture; these are not faults, but part of the quality of the skin.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Before exposure to moisture, you can apply leather/suede protector to your shoes or boots (we recommend Scotchgard) to prevent rain marking the leather. However, many scuffs and marks can be renovated by lovingly polishing with the correct products - your footwear will look all the better for it.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Many of our shoes and boots are made with leather soles which provide a beautiful finish but may be a little slippery until they are well worn in. Do take extra care when walking, especially on stairs. Leather soles are a natural product and are porous in wet conditions. Leave wet shoes to dry naturally (never by artificial heat). The addition of a rubber sole and heel pieces by a cobbler will help extend the life of your leather soles and will provide extra protection.</p>
                                                                                    <p>When you're not wearing your shoes or boots stuff them with tissue or newspaper to help keep their shape.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Here we have provided some basic care guidelines to take into consideration when caring for your Toast footwear.</p>

We recommend Kiwi shoe polish which comes in a range of colours. Apply with a soft brush and polish off with a different soft brush. A final shine can be given by buffing with a soft cloth.</p>

                                                                                    <p>Be sure to never use a polish on this leather because you will make it shiny. Instead, we recommend using a saddle soap to clean your matt leather footwear. A good saddle soap is Belvoir Glycerine.</p>
                                                                                    <p>First clean the footwear with a damp sponge to remove any dirt and allow to dry. When dry, take a very slightly damp sponge and rub it on the saddle soap to get a covering of very slightly soapy residue that you can then apply (if your sponge is too wet, the soap will get very foamy and the final effect will not be so good). Then leave to dry naturally.</p>
                                                                                    <p>NB: Scratches can easily be removed using Nivea hand cream, but please contact <a href="mailto:contact@toa.st">customer service</a> for more information.</p></p>

                                                                                    <p>Through the course of time, fabric footwear with a metallic finish may show some signs of fading - usually around the areas where they have most wear and tear. To care for your metallic footwear, we advise to clean using a damp cloth to wipe off any dirt.</p>
                                                                                    <p>NB: Take care when wearing fabric footwear in the rain as the effect could be irreversible.</p>

Instead you can use steam to renovate your footwear.</p>
                                                                                      <p>Hold the skin in a jet of steam and use a stiff, clean shoe brush to raise the nap of the suede and to remove small marks. Take great care with this as steam can scald. When you have gone over the entire surface of the footwear, stuff the inside with some newspaper or tissue to re-shape nicely and leave to dry naturally.</p>
                                                                                      <p>Very stubborn suede marks can be tackled successfully with a good suede shampoo, suede sponge or by rubbing with a clean India rubber when dry.</p>

To start, tie a length of string or knitting wool around your waist (this is much higher than you expect, it is the narrowest part). Then, measure with a tape around the position of the string. This is how we define the term 'waist'. 'Below waist' and 'low waist' are approximately 2.5cm and 5cm lower respectively. Leave the string on in order to take your next measurement.</li>
                                                                                                        <li>Hip - At the side of your hip, measure 20cm down from the string around your waist. Use the sellotape to mark this spot. Now measure around the hips at this point remembering to keep the tape level.</li>
                                                                                                        <li>Leg Length - Ask your (good) friend to measure from your crotch to where your trouser is usually worn on.</li>

A single t-shirt can require about 100-150g of pesticides. This is damaging both for the planet and also for the growers who are exposed to these chemicals. Additionally, producing organically supports bio-diversity in the environment.

Since then we have increased our use of organic products by introducing several styles which are made from organic materials. Importantly most of our bedlinen and many other home products are made from organic cotton as well as some of our jersey and food products. We will continue to try to add to this range in the future.
